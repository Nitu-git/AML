# FLAME-AI-Challenge-2024-MIS-382N
My team and I tried to predict the fire line for the next 20 time stamps based on just the first 5 timestamps - FLAME AI 2024 challenge! This project was done as a part of the Advanced Machine Learning Coursework for MSBA.

# Methods Tried:
1.Optical Flow

2.XGBoost

3.PredFormer

4.Convolutional Neural Nets with LSTM 


Please go through the presenation given in this project repository for a brief on the data and the results
